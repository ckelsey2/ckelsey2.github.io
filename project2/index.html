            <p slidein class=information-section-text> Tea is rooted in both ancient and modern history. According to legend, tea was found in 2737 BC when Chinese Emperor Shen Nung’s servant was boiling drinking water, when some leaves from a tree blew into his water. This tree, called Camellia sinensis, is the tree from which all tealeaves are picked. Timing of picking these leaves and their oxidation levels give rise to different breeds of tea. Tea grew rapidly throughout China; containers have been found in tombs dating back to the Han dynasty (206 BC).In the sixteenth century, the popularity of tea was spread globally by means of European trading companies who ventured to the East, like the Dutch and Portuguese. The British East India Company brought tea to London in 1658, where it became established as a royalty good and a drink that has been loved for generations.

                Recently, scientific research has indicated that tea may have widespread and pertinent health benefits, and as a result, has soared in popularity. For example, it has been found that many types of tea contain substances called polyphenols, which are antioxidants that reduce the formation of free radicals in the body, protecting cells from DNA damage. Different types of teas have both similar and varying health benefits; overall, tea has been established as a healthy and delicious drink.
