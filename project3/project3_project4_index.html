            <p>Based on personal interest, I decided to create a mock trail running conference, performing research on current trends and models within the trail running world. By exploring the adaptability and hierarchical benefits of varied organization of type, I was able to study the limits of readability and highly structured information, compared to more expressive playfulness. Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign were all utilized to emulate topographical lines and mud prints; a self-made, unique grid system was utilized as well.
            </p>
            
            <p>Next (shown below), I created a long, communicative motion piece was to integrate typography and image, with sound, moving in time and space. I learned differences and similarities between conveying information in handout/poster form and in a time-based medium. (Information from this motion-piece was based on a mock conference poster series, created in another project). Music selection, carefully chosen with Creative Commons license and formatted to need with Adobe Audition, was important in creating cohesive timing and adding interest and readability to the motion piece. A rough-cut piece was utilized in preliminary drafts to identify functional music timing. Pieces were imported from Illustrator and then edited, using three-dimensional facets, with After Effects. Special interest and editing was applied in creating cohesive transitional elements.

           This project allowed me to explore many different facets of design: poster design, illustration, hierarchy, motion design, music, and more. Its integrative elements allowed me to maintain consistency across a broad spectrum of materials.
