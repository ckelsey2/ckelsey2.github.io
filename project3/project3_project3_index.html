            <p> My basis of the project began with the fact that Aloe Vera beverages in the current market resemble topical aloe vera; this is a problem. I moved away from the realistic and dense photography of current aloe vera markets, and decided to use a quart gallon (recognizable drink product) that can be shared at home or work with others. </p>

<p> In my research stages, I observed current juice, healthy soda, and noticed trends towards simplistic design. Noticed emphasis on sources and transparency of ingredients, listed health benefits, colors to reflect the flavors, and an overall movement toward cleanliness (rather than the realistic and dense photography of current aloe vera markets). A matte white finish was utilized. </p>



<p> In terms of creating the proudct, the logo is a simple, geometric, pleasant design that is easily translatable and applicable to other flavors, signage, etc. The brand name comes from the basis of the word “vera”: meaning “truth” in Latin, which is explicitly explained on one side of the carton. Verda also means “green” in several languages: expanding the universality of the product. The colors have similar RGB values to create a continuation of system.</p>

<p> For the overall design, I wished to 1) emphasize the historical aspects of the use of aloe vera and to 2) educate market consumers about the benefits and history of aloe vera juice, similarly as coconut water was expedited to consumer success a few years ago. I incorporated a pattern system that evokes the regions from which aloe vera is notably used (North Africa, the Middle East). Uses by Cleopatra and Alexander the Great are cited on the design to create a universality throughout time and history. </p>

<p> Finally, for the package itself, a die-cut was printed on matte white paper and pasted with care on matte-white spray painted quart bottles.</p>

            I learned how to incorporate market research and trends, as well as user needs, in this project. I also learned how to incorporate a uniform and consistent branding system across all dimensions of the final product.
