            <p> I chose to re-design a basketball shoe package design for middle school boys, based on research that showed the uniformity of packages within the industry and potential for boutique company growth. I chose to use a triangular shape with corrugated cardboard to increase recyclability and ability to choose and change unique shelving displays. The idea of the branding comes from the middle schooler’s love for current media trends and celebration culture of sports, like the “three” celebratory pose that often follows professional players’ shots. I hand-crafted illustration on Illustrator to include as the top face of the box.</p>
            
            <p>
            A simple color palette was used. A logo was created based off this branding strategy, both as a symbol and as a combined logo. Gestalt principles were used in fashioning this hypothetical “Three” brand. </p>
            
            <p>
            The front facing side of the box features a “pull” unit, flanked on either side by high-powered magnets that allow for ease of opening and closing; user studies indicated a frustration with shoving shoes back into the box after trying them on. A precisely cut foam piece with indents for the shoes solves this problem; a shoelace is attached for pulling out ease. Furthermore, due to discrepancies between footwear brands in terms of sizing, I implemented a sizing mechanism. The cobalt blue side depicts an area to “place heel here”, with several different markers indicating which shoe size, from 3.5 to 7. This feature would also reduce the hassle of having to re-measure a growing middle school boy’s foot size. </p>
            
            <p> Finally, working with Notre Dame’s Innovation Lab, I was able to use a hi-tech laser-cutter with correct dimensions to craft a model of the actual box.</p>

        <div class="project-text-3">
            This project pushed my creativity: thinking outside of the box to account for and fix observed user difficulties. I learned how to create custom die-cuts, how to incorporate illustration styles in congruence with logo and physical box designs, how to utilize other external sources (the Innovation Lab), and how to think about and create packacing in singular and multiple values.
